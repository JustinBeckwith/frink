Greetings Reddit!  Welcome to the Frink Project - a crummy world of plot holes 
and spelling errors.  While this code technically hasn't been released
yet, it will eventually be under an open source license of some variety.  This 
application is meant to be the first steps towards a universal reddit client for
tablets.  A lot of the UI ideas come from the Twitter app for iPad, but I wanted
to create something that worked across many systems and used HTML5/CSS3.  

With only 10 days to work on the project, a fairly demanding full time gig nearing 
the end of a release cylce, and a couple of kids, I wasn't able to get as far as I 
would have liked.  

what should work
-------------------------------
* reading posts from the front page
* reading all posts
* getting a list of subreddits
* reading all posts from a subreddit
* viewing post details
* viewing post comments


known issues
-------------------------------
* the iPad doesn't render scrollbars (at all) in web applications.  Until I write my 
  own scrollbars, two-finger scrolling does work
  (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3845445/how-to-get-the-scroll-bar-with-css-overflow-on-ios)
* waiting cursors aren't implemented (there is a hook in the code show/hide Spinny)
* iframes can be powerful, ugly creature.  Some sites break out of them, and there's not a whole lot you can do.
* logins currently aren't wired up
* the profile page needs to be completed
* the search page needs to be completed
* the new post page needs to be completed
* the mail workflow needs to be completed
* there are small bugs here and there

If you want to take a look at this on the web, it's available online at 
http://jbeckwith.com/wp-content/frink/.  (I haven't advertised it yet).  It's tested with the following
browsers:

* FireFox 3.6
* Chrome 9.0
* iOS 4.2 (w/ two finger scroll)
